            <li class="Carson"> Carson Carlhoun <p>Hi, My name is Carson Calhoun and I am a sophomore at 
                Colorado State University. I am studying Computer Science with a concentration in network 
                security! I currently work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS 220. When I'm not 
                doing computer science you can catch me outside hiking, skiing, biking or really just anything 
                to get outside</p></li>
                
            <li class="Grayson"> Grayson Morris <p>Hi, I'm Grayson Morris, I'm a 4th year Computer Science 
                student at CSU concentrating in Networks and Security. I currently work for the Lory Student 
                Center Information Technology team, where I kind of am a jack of all trades, writing shell/SQL 
                scripts, configuring networks, and setting up systems. When Im not in work or school you can 
                find me doing anything outdoors from hunting/fishing to hiking 14'ers to snowboarding, ya know 
                typical Colorado stuff</p></li>
